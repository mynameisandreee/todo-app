# Todo App homework#5

## Description/Functionality 
This homework is pretty straigt forward. HTML and CSS was already given to us and we just had to code the function in the JS that makes this app functional. All I had to do for this homework is to add the current date on the header with a format of Day, month and date. And then on the HTML pretty much just copy paste the given example of each timeblock and change its id to 24 hour corresponding to the hour and change its text to 1pm, 2pm, 3pm etc. and then in the JS I added code that changes color of the timeblock. if the timeblock is in past it would be grey and if current then the color would be red and the future would be green. And when the save button is clicked whatever in the textarea would be saved in the localstorage and then get that data from the local storage and display it to the text area so even if we refreshed the page it would still be displayed.
